For a large portion of my life I have had a uniue relationship to sleep. I have had both issues falling asleep, sleeping, and waking up; as well as rather wild dreams when I do sleep. I have decided to make this website based around this topic, as I am definitely an expert in my own sleep and I find it interesting to talk/write about.


As for my ideas for this page:

I tried to space the sections from the edges of the screen to make it easier to read. If the text is too wide left/right then it can be difficult to read properly. Still need to actually set a width. atm it's just using padding and margins, so it doesn't look very readable on smaller screens.
The background for the sections was made because reading text off the website image background was difficult. I made it transparent so it would keep some of that background image effect without making the text unreadable.
I have picked grey for the text because black is unreadable and white is too harsh a contrast with the background.

The first div is going to be an introductory section describing the purpose of this website.

The second div is going to be used for navigating to other pages each with their own topics from my experiences (Sleeping better, dreaming (potentially even adding a few entries from my dream journal), sleep paralysis, etc)
Potentially will be using flexboxes for this, and if I can think of good images for them might use images in the labels. Could also make images like the one I used for the website background for this.

The footer I may link external resources in, if I can think of any. Most of this site is just going to be my own experiences, though.
The footer background is more transparent and simpler and the text is darker than the above sections to deemphasize it. It doesn't have the website's main content and is less important to it, so I don't want it to be as eye catching.

The background I would like to figure out how to make it scroll at a different rate than the website content.
I picked this background image because it fits with the website topic. It's dark and nebulous like sleep is.

Still haven't decided on what font to use for the site so have just left it as is for now.
Also still haven't added any of the actual content to the site so far this is just the structure/styling.
